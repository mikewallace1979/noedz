## What is this?

A message-passing framework for concurrent processing using Python Multiprocessing.

## Why would you even?

Entirely educational purposes. The main benefit is that we can have absolute control
over message delivery which means we can simulate all sorts of different partitioning
events and other failure modes. This will make it possible to test implementations of
distributed algorithms with a reasonable degree of rigour.

## I still don't get it

Basically I'm trying to improve my level of distributed systems knowledge. This means
there are decades of papers to read and it turns out I find things that are purely
theoretical hard to understand - I learn more by trying things out in practice.

## Can I run this in production?

Only if you want to ruin your shit.
